        "description": "If you’re a programmer new to JavaScript, or even a beginner with little or no programming experience, this latest edition of practical book offers complete, no-nonsense coverage of this essential web development language. Learning JavaScript follows proven learning principles to help you absorb the concepts at an easy pace, so you’ll learn how to create powerful and responsive applications in any browser. Rather than simply teach JavaScript as an imperative language, author Ethan Brown (Web Development with Node and Express) introduces functional and asynchronous programming concepts early and reinforces them often. This book also gives equal preference to JavaScript’s use as a \"traditional\" language (with filesystem and console access) and to its use as a browser-based language. Learn the latest in JavaScript developments, including Ajax and JSON Get concrete examples of common JavaScript usage patterns Deal with complications of different browser implementations Use best practices for this complex language",

        "description": "This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP \"capabilities\" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript's prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript's prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypical languages, like Self). JavaScript's object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript's prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance. What You'll Learn What are objects, JavaScript objects and object programming What is and how to use inheritance and JavaScript inheritance as well as inheritance alternatives How to design for JavaScript What are and how to use OO principles in JavaScript How to use Constructors with JavaScript and more AudienceThis book is for both intermediate and advanced JavaScript and Web development programmers. However, any programmer will understand the concepts and any JavaScript programmer should understand all of the concepts in this book. The code there is shows examples of the concepts discussed.",

This book is also for web/front-end developers who would like webapps to be developed faster and more easily using the ReactJS framework. Basic knowledge of JavaScript is expected. What You Will Learn Learn functional reactive programming with JavaScript for non-mathematicians Experience Facebook's primary front-end framework, ReactJS Using the tools Facebook uses to build a better site in less time Create and implement Node.js Delve into the development of webapps using ReactJS Implementation of FRP ReactJS with live examples In Detail Reactive programming is carried out using the building blocks of functional programming. JavaScript libraries such as ReactJS are used for front-end web development that is both competent and powerful. ReactJS is intensively being used to develop webapps for Facebook. This title is among the first of those addressing how everyday programmers can take advantage of (functional) reactive programming without having an extremely heavy mathematical background. It starts with the basics a front-end developer can easily connect with, while also covering the basics of functional programming. Then it goes on to explain non-functional reactive programming with the help of a live example. After that it gives a theoretical overview of reactive programming supported by functional programming. Tools to make functional reactive programming easier like Bacon.js, a library like jQuery, are also covered. Finally, it finishes with building one small and one larger front-end project. Style and approach A rounded and multifaceted approach covers reactive JavaScript with Facebook's ReactJS. The author's lively approach makes the book even more engaging. Also, with easy-to-understand examples, readers will learn how to use functional reactive programming with JavaScript.",

        "description": "This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP \"capabilities\" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript's prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript's prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypical languages, like Self). JavaScript's object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript's prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance. What You'll Learn What are objects, JavaScript objects and object programming What is and how to use inheritance and JavaScript inheritance as well as inheritance alternatives How to design for JavaScript What are and how to use OO principles in JavaScript How to use Constructors with JavaScript and more AudienceThis book is for both intermediate and advanced JavaScript and Web development programmers. However, any programmer will understand the concepts and any JavaScript programmer should understand all of the concepts in this book. The code there is shows examples of the concepts discussed.",

        "description": "JavaScript applications of today look a lot different from their predecessors of just five years ago. Because of this rapid growth in sophistication and capabilities, we've seen an explosion in JavaScript frameworks; the JavaScript development landscape is a fragmented one. To build large-scale JavaScript applications, we need more than just tools – we need scalable architectures. We create scalable JavaScript architectures by looking at what aspects of our application need to scale and why. Only then can we apply the best patterns and components to our architecture, scaling it into the future. JavaScript at Scale will show you how to deal with scalability from a number of perspectives; addressability, testability and component composition. The book begins by defining 'scale' from a JavaScript point of view, and dives into the influencers of scale, as well as scalable component composition and communication. We will also look at how large-scale architectures need the ability to scale down, and recover from failing components, as well as scale up and manage new features or a large user base. Filled with real-world JavaScript scaling scenarios, and code-first examples, JavaScript at Scale is your guide to building out applications that last. Each topic is covered in a way that it can be applied to your own unique scenarios; by understanding the fundamentals of a scaling issue, you'll be able to use that knowledge to tackle even the most difficult of situations. The code examples follow the same approach, using ECMAScript 6 syntax that can be translated to the framework of choice.",
